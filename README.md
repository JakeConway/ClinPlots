# ClinPlots
### An R package to create clinico-genomic charts

There is a need to rapidly and effectively summarize multivariate risk information for patients and physicians. Many visualizations that accomplish this task are exhibited in the paper [*Clinical assessment incorporating a personal genome*](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)60452-7/fulltext), which provides the motivation for developing this package. Two examples of these figures can be seen below, whose reproduction will become automated through this package.
